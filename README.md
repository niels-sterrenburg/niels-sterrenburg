This is the repo from Niels Sterrenburg.

I keep here all the software that I found worthy to expose to the world ;-)
Which is a very very small subset of the software I have written :P

Key areas of interest to me:
- Home automation 
- Carrera Race track monitors
- Backup/network/install/diagnostic scripting for my BSD/Linux systems
- Arduino robotics thingies
- Stuff I forgot to mention :-)
